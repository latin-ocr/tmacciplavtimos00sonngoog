EXCURSUS

On tle Moods employed in Qmstons as to what is to be done.

Ι11 my notes 66 Most. 368, 371, 392 1 have made uo attempt to
distinguish quid ago? from quid agam? or 11616 similar questions in
which the Futnre indicative is used. The latest investigatiou 61 this
point is contained iu Dr. H. Sjbgren's Zum Gebrauclv des Futumms
im Altlatcimtchen (Up la, 1906), a work which 1 had not read
until aiter the whole 6 my commentary to the present edition was
written and printed, but 16 which tuave referred iu some passages 61
my educat notes. Sjiigreu’s results are based on a 6616161 study 61 all
previous work bearing 66 the subject, aud he distinguishes (pp. 81 ii&
questions in the first person asto what ⁴ is to be done' with the
’ indicative, like quid agei, 11661 111666 with the subjunctive; and these
latter¹ he again distinguishes on the lines 61 Morris² according as the
subjunctive rs (1) accompauied by ego or nunc or bethago and nunc, or
(ii) not so accompanied. To questions 61 the type quid ego agumi,
quid ego nunc agam i, quid num agam? (e. g. Most. 378, 666, Amph.
104⁶) he concedes the name ‘deliberative ', as expressiug perplexity,
des 'r, aa, mainly in monologue; questions like quid agami(e.g.
Mi ,363 Aut 651) he describes as ‘ questions 161 161611661166 asto the
vish or will 61 auother’ (Areskunftsfragm): questions like quid ago?
(e. g. Pers 666, Meu. 176) he 66116ι consultative questions ¹, 1. e. questions
161 16161616ῑί66 aa to the views or opinions 61 another-the questioner
asking in a calm tone how he ought to act under the particular circum-
stances. F urther, he marks 611 as a special gruum the questions com·
mouly called ‘angry questions' like solus cenabo domi . (Stich. 599).
The last three classes usuall appear in dialogue. ln the light 61
these results Sjo n rejects tbe emendation quid ego ago? Most. 368,
where he would here to quid ego agam? SMSS.)⁸ I believe that these
distinctions are on the whole well-loun ed in Plautino usage; but

¹ So iar as relates to agere, and partly to jacere. Sjbgreu recognizes
that other verbs do 661 require the addition 61 ego or nunc to 16116 a
‘deliberative’ uestiou, 6. g. quid machiner? Capt. 531.

¹ On Principia and Methods iu Latin Syutax, p. 616 (New York,
19inibe nam he would connect with Tranio's reply, quoting (in support
cinam id tu, malum) Amph. 591, Rud. 945, which he considers
bifidi& ynplarallel, though the nam does 661 16 111666 1116166666 precede

equ ‚ uns.
