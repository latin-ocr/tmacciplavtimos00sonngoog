184 ‘imaeo me'er‘ta artace me ’timaret ‘What about she me
(=wbat about her loving me), why was not that addedl’-the id
referring to the phrase istaec mc. The meaning would have been clearer
if Plautus had written Ita istaec me, without the quali.

infecta, δια, ‘ I revoke my presente '.

185. dono, a predicated dative, as in dono dare, &o

186. doctam, ‘ clever'.

187. stultam stulte, ⁴ in auch a silly silly way ⁹. The effect of the
combinatiou is that the adj. and adv. mutually strengtheu one another:
bnt the total effect is adverbiali, as in Rud. 426 bellam belle tangere, ‘to
give a sweet sweet embrace' and Curc.521 sequere istum bella belle,
‘follow him, like a good good girl '‚ cf. Asin. 676. So in Greek κακὸς

tula we have the opposite order of adv. and adj. So in S r (quoted

⁵ uon-eatur. The verb uersari in Plautus is, as Langen remarks,
never used in the later sense of ‘to be engaged with (upon) ¹: it has
lanvays a strictly local sense; here, ‘to take up one's abode’, ‘to
nestle ¹. Conversely uerti is used for the classical uersari ; cf. 639.
illud, with a gesture ‘yonder’: cf. Amph. 543 lucescit hoc ianr,
where hec corresponds to the gesture of pointing to the sky.
19²· pessumis exemplis, so ²¹²3 cf. notes ou 54, ιο4ο. Phrases
formed with exemplis and modis are nearly equiv. to emphatic adverbs:
artie-is erodis ‘strangely', ‘in wondrous wise’, indrgnrs nemis (1033)
‘shamefully '3 pessumis exanguis¹ interf ‘ to put to a horrible death ¹.
194. male praecipere, ‘to give bad advice‘.
196. aetate et satietate. Note the jingle: ‘age and surfeitage ¹,
‘ when you are older and he is colder '. Scapha is probably only taking
