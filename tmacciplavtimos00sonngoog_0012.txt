PREFACE vii ·

in cases where some kind of 'syniaesis may be assumed.
For example, my ictus on theu of quattuor in l. 630 is
meant to indicate merely that taor forms the rise (or arsis)
of the first foot, not that quattuor is to be pronounced as
three full syllables with the accent on the second. It cannot
be too clearly understood that ictus-magius are not indications
of word-accent or sentence-aecem, but merely a means of
dividing lines into ieet or dipodies. They serve, in fact, the ¹
humble obJ'ect ol helping the reader to scan, though they
may and do indirectly surnish evidence ol the incidence of
word-accent and sentence-secent.

In the revision ol the proof·sheets1have had the assistance
of two friends, one of whom, alas, is no longer among us.
Professor O. Seyffert of Berlin, with characteristic devotion,
read part of the proof as it was going through the press,
in spite oi the lact that he was suffering srom the effects

ol a paralytic stroke. The commenta which he was able to
send me before his death in July os last year were not many,
but they were of great value. Professor Postgate has most
kindly read the whole of the explanatory notes and made
several helplul suggestions which Ι have embodied, some·

times with a reference to his name. And to the Reader oi
the Clarendon Press 1 am indebted for the thoroughness with
which he has done his work.

As in my Rudens (ed. min), the text is interleaved to

facilitate the collecting os notes and comparison ol instances. ,
