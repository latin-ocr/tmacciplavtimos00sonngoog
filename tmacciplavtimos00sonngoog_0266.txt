170 · MOSTELLARIA

Inotice that in one oi the instances cited as an Auskunstg'ragr there
isan ego (Trin. 981). Another difficulty is that degrens distinctions
do not quite apply when the verb is facere instead of agere, as he
himself shows (p. 85): quid faciam? is both an Auskunftsfrage aud
a Konrultatahe Frage, and quidsacr'o? does not occur in this sense:
nor does the usage oi Terence quite agree with that of Plautus (pp. 83

and 86). The distinction between Auskunftsfragen and Konmltative
Fragm seems to me almost too fine drawn;¹ but on one point at any
rate we ure agreed, viz. that the term ⁴ deliberative’ is inappropriate to
this class of questions as a whole. 1 will add that some common
name ior the whole class is needed to mark it off broadly from qnes-
tions as to amatter of fact. Tenus like ‘consultative questions‘ and
‘angry questions' serve only to distinguish the species of a genus,
and a briei name ior the genus is still to seek.

¹ For instance, in Bacch. 630 we find, in answer to the command
bonum habe animum, the reply unde habeam ?, which would be accord·
tt ‘titttkkhmittli'ztt {illitati {titianeni
would be a Kamullativa Frage, like quidfit? ‘what is to be ’donet'
Pseud. 1159, Cist. 769. Sjogreu admits, however, that these meanings
easily pass into one another (p. 90).-1t may be added that the nse oi
the lndic (quid aga ?) in Plautus, according to Sjiigren‘s interpretation,
hardly agrees with that early Latin use oi the phrase agane? or ago ?, in
which the sacrificial attendant asked the priest whether he was to strike
the victim, and the priest answered age or hoc agr (Varro L. L VI. 12);
ior the question clearly related to the will, not to the views or opinions,
of the priest. As Ovid says (Fasti 1 322), Semper ‘agonei' rogat, nec
nisi iusms agit. On this use of ago? see Postgate in Classical Roaiam,
vol. xv, p. 452, to whom belongs the creditos having first called atten-
tion to the desecta oi the term ‘deliberative’ (vol. xiii, p. 414 and p. os;
ci. my note in vol. rvi, p. 16⁶, where I include ‘ dubitative' in the same
condemnation).
