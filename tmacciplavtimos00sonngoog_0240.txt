idea oi a new piot. Note that the author of tie Greek original (the
Φάσμα) speaks of Diphilus aud Philemon as his contemporaries. If the
Φάσμα was written yPhilemon himself see Intr. p. ix), he seems to
have introduced his own name here fort e sake of the comic effect.
The passage also throws light on the date of the death of Diphilus,
which must have occurred sume considerable time after tae. 289
(see on 775). We also see why Menander is not mentioned among the
contemporary comedians; he was no longer alive when the play was
written. [The dates of these writers of the New Comedy are probably
somewhat as follows :-
Philemon, born about 560, died aba (98 years of age);
Diphilus, born between 555 and 550, died say about ²⁸03
Menander, born 342, died ²90·
