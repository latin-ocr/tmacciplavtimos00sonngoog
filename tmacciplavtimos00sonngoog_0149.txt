Itis uncertain whether the name of the father yof Philolaches rs
'Pheoropides or wneoprnptdes. The latter, accepted by all editors
since Bergk, has the advantage of being an actual Greek name, found
in Pausanias X. 9. rand ιιι inscriptions. But' ιιι the MSS. the iorm' rs
generally either Theoropides (so A, four or five times) or Theuropides (so
P, sixteen times). the only trace of a p before the r is in 784 and 962,
where B has Τ heuprqiides (We also find -tropides as the last part of
the name in two scene headings,lll. 1,111. r according toB and D.)
Either form suits the metre, except ιιι 784, where Thldropides suits
per fectly and mwprastdes does not: nor is it possible to emend the line
without ydoing violence to the bacchiac metre. This fect seems decisive
in favour of Thenrdpides. Many Plautine names are corn es of Plautus
