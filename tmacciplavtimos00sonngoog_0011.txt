vi PREFACE

to the ‘semi-quantitative' character of Old Latin verse an<
their bearing on fundamental questions of prosody, such a
the law of ‘Breves breviantes ', have been briefly indicated ir
an article in ,the Classical Reaiew (‘Accent and Quantity ir
Plautina Verse,’ 1906, voi. xx, pp. 156-9). To set them

forth fn detail in the present edition would have demanded
more space than I had at my disposal ς and I have thought

it better to reserve them for a separate work on metre and
prosody, on which 1 have been engaged for many years.¹

lirlef references are, however, made to the above article in
cases where my special views have a bearing on the text
(eg. note on l. 656). Similarly in regard to the scansion
of ille, nempe, &c., in lines like aro and 335a,1 have con-
tented myself with a reference to an article by Radford in
which the latest discussion of rival theorias is contained.²
In the use of ictus-marks in the text l have followed the
same principle asin the ‘editio minor' of my Rudens-
a principle which is also adopted in the main by Goetz and
Schoell in their latest edition.³ But these marks are not to
be interpreted as implying dissent from the views of Radford

¹ 1 shall there take accountof much recent work, such as the article
by Jacobsohn (Quaestionem Plautinae metricae et grammaticae), in
which he provee that the verse-ending ῦ-υ-, whether in iambic
senarii or in trochaic septenarii, may be preceded by a ‘s llaba anceps'
orb hiatus, and further applies the same treatment to e second rise
of tie troch. septen.

² ‘Plautine synizesis,a study of the phenomena of brevis coalescens,’
ln Transactians afilae American Piri alagical Arsaciatien, 1905 (vol.
xxxvi), pp. 159-61 3 see also the vol. for 1904 (xxxv), p. 44. Radford’s
own view as to the pronunciatiou of the ‘dimoric ille, nempe, &c., is
that there was some reductiou in the quantitative value of betis the
syllables, aud that it is not necessary to hold with Skutsch that the
second syllable was entirely dropped. [A fuller study of the question
by the same author has been commenced in the Anserican saumal aff
Philalagy, 1906 (vol. xxvii), pp. 418-37.]
