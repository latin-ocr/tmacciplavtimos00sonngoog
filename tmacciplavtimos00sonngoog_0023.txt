hall ol the action, and this is simply a reproductiou oi t
Mostellaria: Tranio is represented by the sowing-nu
Ret'gnnld‚ Grumio by Rubris, Philolaches by Lr'onell, The
ropides by Old Lionell Callidamates by Rtoter, Simo l
Illaster Rt'cott, Philematium by Blanda3 Scapha is the nan
ol the old servant woman in both plays' This by·pl
stands in avery loose connexion with the main plot, uhic
appears to have been considered by the author as too thiu l
form aplay by itsell.1 Another play in which the Mostellati
occupies a similar position is ze Comldt'en Pota by Mom
fleury (1674); here the play of Plautus forms the first Act
which is almost entirely diseonnected with the rest ol th
play. There are many other modern plays which are sair
by some writers to be based to a greater or less extent ot
the Mostellaria 3 lor example The Drummer or The Hauntet
Haase by Addison; but the main lines of the plot are s<
different that the connexion is doubtful. The Ariadneis by
Lorenzino de' Medici (1549) owes *something to the Mostel
laria in one scene 3 but it is in the main based upon the
Aulularia ol Plautus, with reminiscences from other plays ;

¹ Heywood no doubt agreed with the principle subsequently enun-
ciatetl by Fielding: ‘The ancients may be considered as a rich common,
whereon every person who hath the smallest tenement in Parnassus has
tlte right to latten his muse. Nor shall Ι ever scruple to take to myself
nny passage which I shall find in any ancient author to my purpose
raithout setting maun tte name os tlte auther from whom it was taken'
(quoted by Prolessor Paul Shotey in his address on the ‘Relations of
Classical therature 'to other branches os leaming' at the Congress of
Arts and Science‚ St. Louis, 1904, vol. iii, p. 3843 the italics are mine).
In his captives (licensed 1624, first printed by Mr. A. H. Bullen in
his Collecttim of Old English Plays, vol. iv, 1885) Heywood has taken
the main plot from the Rudens of Plautus and the by-plot (according
to nlr. J. A. Symonds, in a letter to the Academy, dated Dec. 7, 1885)
lrom Masuoclo'a Novellim.
