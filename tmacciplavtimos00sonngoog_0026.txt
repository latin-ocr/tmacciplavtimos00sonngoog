INTRODUCTION xxi

some plays of Plautus and Terence resist any such division.

Apparently, then, an old Latinplay consisted simply of

a succession of scetus, and it is this that is reproduced in our
MSS. of both families.1

This play has suffered seriously by transposition of pages
in the archetype from which BCD are derived. The result
is that in these three MSS. a large part of the text is
dislocatedz’ 802-841 are placed aster 842-883: further, ’
601-646 follow after 884, 885 a, and 647-685 aiter 885b-

¹ The history of the five-act rule, which has played sc important
a part ln modern literature, isan interesting one. It seems to have
originated among the critica and perhaps also the playwrights of
Alexandria in the third century B.c.; see Ussing, Prolegomena tc his
edition of Plautus, p. 165, and leo, Forsckungan, p. 207 n. Thence it
passed to Rome, where it was adopted aa an essential clement in the
theory of the dmmain the first century nc. by Varro, and later on by
Horace, Ars Partha, 189 :-
Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu
Fabula quae posci uolt et spectata reponi.

Varro applied the theory to the plays cf Terence and perhaps also of
Plautus, diriding them iuto live actss bnt there is nothing to show
that the theory was known at Rome before his time. In tlre early
empire we find the rule thoroughly established in the tragedies of
Seneca (also the Octavia), and lt is probable that if we possessed the
Ajax of Angustus or the Thyestes of Varius or the Medea of Ovid we
should find that they too were divided into five acts From Seneca the
practice passed to the scholars of the Reuaiasauce and the Elisabethan
&amahus-a striking illustration of the lnfluence of Hellenists'c litera-
tnre, through Rome, upon modern literary usage-though the men cf
the Renaissauce may also have been influenoed by the precept cf
Horace. Tne liveact rule was clearly not known to the Greek tragic
or comlc poeta of the fifth century n.c.: their dramaa have nc fixed
number of ‘ acts’. Thus ln Sophocles and Euripides wc find that the
isendica together with the epoho-yos and leodos amount often to six and
sometimes to seven in number. Aristotle, who speaks of the pipp of
a tragedy‚ never mentions any fixed number of ἐπεισόδια.
⁸ The palimpsest has escaped this error cf transposition.
