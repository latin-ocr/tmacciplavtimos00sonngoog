Plautus and Terence, including A, for the ahcus. plur. in the phrase
dies noctesque {debs noctes, dios atque noctes) and t e epually common
noctes diesque noctes et dus, noctesque et does), perhaps or the sake of

the assonance; see ou Rud. 380, ed. maior.

Plantns; but cf. Pseud. 6ι3 quom abiit, Poen. 77, 904, 1070 quom obiit
diem. Scan iit as υυ.

38. nie BD, rut C, Pfui Ussing- tschl transfert the word to the
next line (su, oboluisti), and he is followed by Ga-Sch., who read susae
oboluisti (fu aseja), loa, Leo, and Lindsay. But the ejaculatron is
necessary iu the mouth of Grumio to ex lain the imprecatlon of
'l'ranio; besides Ritschl's reading mentesa ifficulty about the rfect
oboluisti (not removed by Lorenz); it would have to be eqni ent to
a 1{rpesel'l’he hiatus before alium mi ht possibly be removed by inserting
mi; a dative is found after olere (obolon, icc), though not side by side
with a cognate accus, in Men. 84 oboluit mormppium huri, ‘she has

ot scent of the urse,’ Aul. ιι6 aarum huic olet, ‘he scents my gold,'

il. 41 ut praeoiht mihi quadiu uels‘s, ‘that I may have an inlrling.'

the principle of leo, that final saftma short vowel may be dropped
before a word beginning witha vowel, and that thus elision may take
place: the rh thm of the verse ismucb improved if the dactylic
word is equivahent to two syllables (lachmanns law). An argument
in favour oflaeo's doctrine is that it explains such common contractioris
as scelestu'st -scelestus est, nanctu’s= nonnus os: bnt these are explained
byLlndsay as dne to prodelislou, like Engl. it’s, ho's. [It would also be

possible to read the voc. miste, side by side with hirenes, aa in Asin 664 .

meuspullus passer . . . mi 14446]

note. scri is often found at the end of au iambic or trochaic line wit
the first syllable long, eg. Amph. 587, Trin. ⁵3²2 Capt. 843, though
elsewhere ln the line we find eri, e. g. Amph 693.

that the first preserves its identity more completely than lethe case ln
ordinary elffimnithwgh in uo caseis au ‘elided' vowel completely

The foss of a line between 43 and 43 is amumed by Gz.·Sch to
explain the construction of superior (sing). 'ibe words qnam eras
