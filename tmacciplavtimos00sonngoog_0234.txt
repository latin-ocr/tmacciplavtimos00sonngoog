1041-63. hlonologue ο1 Tranio, who enters from the angiportmn.

1041. uon nauci esseenihili csse. cf. Truc. 611 arnas baratinam
non nauci, Bacch. 1101 seruam non naresi, fragment 01 Parasitus Piger
ambo sunms non nauci, Cic. de Div. l. 58, 15111111 habeonauri Marsum
augurem. ·

1041. The derivation 01 the word naucum was no doubt a matter 01
speculation even in the time 01 Plautus (ci. Festus, p. 166 M.) ; possibly¹
it is connected with 11115111, as Ritschl thought. Schoell thinks that
when Tranio says that he does not understand the word he means that
he does not understand the thing, i. e. that he is not good ior nothing.
But nauci does not mean good 101 nothing; that is 11111 nauci (‘ not
worth a straw ’).

1043-44. uam: i. e. ‘I myseli know how to behave in rebus dubiis;
ior ’, &c.; 01. on 133. Line 1041 is, 01 course, parenthetical.

a side street leading between the houses 01 Theoropides and 01 Simo to
the gardens at the back; ci. on 931 1.

so (with antecedent repeated alter relative clause) 150.

angiporta (so Α) : abl. 01 angiportum, n.‚ and decl, which is the

ordinary form 01 the word in Plautus (except Cist. 124 P) as in classical

hain: 01. the plural forms angiporta Cist. 584, Pseud. 1235, angiportis
ers. 444.

1050. quoniam: here with its original temporal meaning, as often in
Plautus (though not in Terence), eg. Asin. 350, 711, Mil. 129; it is
derived from quom iam (1. ἐπειδὴ) as 1111111011 110111 nram iam, etiam
lrom et iam.

atque, ‘iorthwith', or ‘lo and behold ’, introducing the principal
clanse; 01. Bacch. 1781. sorte nt adsedi in stega, atquc ego lembum

-, clauses.
me ex senatu nenegant: i. e. seinse to allow rne a voice in the
deliberations3 01. on 688. Philolaches and his friends have determined
to make a clean breast 01 the matter ; so Tranio will save his own slrin
by a new ruse ; cl. 1060-61.
1051. uideo: an historica] present. accompnnied by the same tense in
the principal clause, see latter part 01 the note on postquam sum, 156.
me uenire: lit. ‘that 1 was being sold’, i. e. that I was being
‘given away': this metaphorica] phrase, which may be the source 01
the English phrases ‘sold again 1⁹, ‘what a sellt', &c., is fully explained
by Bacch. 81411. as derived 110111 the sale 01 slaves by, auctiori:
CH. O stulte, stulte, nescis 1111111 uenire 11, atqua in eopse adstas lapriie,

arrodit? To be put up ior sale to the highest bidder is thus equivalent
