and the Miles Gloriosus), has nevertheless been often imitated
An Italian translation by Geronimo Berrardo was produce
on the stage in 15or; and the following adaptations are base
wholly upon the plot of the Mostellaria, though the names r
the dramatis personae have been changed: IFantasmi b
Ereole Bentivoglio (1545); In Retenr Imprluu by Jear
Francois Regnard (1700), which was the immediate source o
The Intriguing Chambermaid by Henry Fielding (acted a
Drury Lane, 17 333 in this play the rble of Tranio is assignet
to the scheming servant girl Lettice); Abracadabra by ‘the
Danish Plautus' Ludwig Holberg(1684-1754 ; in this version
all the female characters are omitted). Besides these adapta·
tions there are a number of plays-enumerated in the following
paragraphs-whieh are partly based on the Mostellaria or
contain episodes or reminiscences from it.

That Shakespeare knew the play, either in the original or
in a translation,l is shown not only by his having taken from
Plautus the names Tranio and Grumio for two waiting-men

² There was no English translation of any os the plays of Plautus in
the sixteenth century except that of the Menaechmi by W. W. (probably
William Warner), published in 1595, i. e. some ten years later than the
date of the Cemedy ef Errers. It seems at least as likely that Shake·
speare read the Mostellaria in the original as that he was acquainted
with one of the Italian versions referred to above. The evidence that
Shakespeare knew Latin is growing stronger every year. I have
recently shown that Portia’s great speech in the Merclrant af Venice,
IV. 1, 184-aoo‚ is based on Seneca’s De Clementia, of which there
was no English translation prior to that of Lodge, published in 1614,
i. e. some twenty years after the probable date of the Marciani of
Venice (see my paper at the Congress of Arts and Science, St. Louis,
U.S.A., 1904, vol. iii, p. 189 f., republished in the Natienal Review for
June, 1906).-I hope before long to publish evidence showing the in·
flnence of Plautus upon many plays of Shakespeare.
