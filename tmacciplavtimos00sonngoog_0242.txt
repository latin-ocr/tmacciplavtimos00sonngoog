difficulty. A knowledge of the ordinary phenomena ofPlautine prosody
is assumed. The terma ‘rise’ and ‘fall’ are bere employed instead of

a ‘ectiva

J8. The word dierectus is always fonr syllables with the first long in
{aurftais except in Trin. 457 where dierecte is trisyllabis according to
te .

9. The word em (en P) was regarded by Ritschl as standing extra
versum (l. 9); but it may be scanned as part of l. ιο, am hocine
standing foralegitirnate proceleusmatic (ὺυυυ); cf. sim mado ιι, ahi

becarm its disyllabic origin (eme) was still felt: see explanatory note.

21. Scan with hiatus at caesura, which is natural, a's there ia a panse

opulescentems, pgrtly to avoid hiatus at this point, partly for the sake of
t esense: c.2 .
