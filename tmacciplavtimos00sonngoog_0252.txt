408-409, which ls a hit at Philolaches, is intended for the ears of the
audience only, to whom Tranio proceeds to expound his plan of

out of the difficulty ’; cf. Bottom in Shalrs. Mid. N. Dr. V. i. 187 ‘You
shall see. it will fall pat as 1 told you ’). We have au exactly parallel
case iu Amph. 1006, where Mercury breaks olf his speech to address

Tranio's question, shores the ey without answeriug in words: but this
is scarcely in Plautus' manner: besides iserniam is unintelligible unless
olecuna is assumed.
