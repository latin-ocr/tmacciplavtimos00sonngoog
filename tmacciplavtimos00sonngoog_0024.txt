. INTRODUCTION xix ’

on this play was founded Les Esprilr by Pierre Larivey
(¹5rol· ’
Tne Tarm.

The principati MSS. containing the Mostellaria, or parts oi
it, are 2-

(i) The Ambrosian palimpsest (A), a MS. of the fourth or
perhaps even oi the third century ran—one of the oldest
MSS. oia Latin author in existence. But only parts of it
are extant3 oi this play we have 354 lines, via. 576-613‚
630, 631, 632, ⁶53-72n 759-796, 826-858, 891-1026
(÷4 lines), ¹04²·10'l3·

(ii) The three ‘Palatine’ MSS. (B,C,D)‚ dating from
about the eleventh century nn.

(iii) The ‘Codex Lipsiensis' (F), a MS. ol the fifteenth
century, and of no authority compared with that oi the other
MSS. referred to above.

Besides these MSS. we have occasional quotations of
passages by grammarians and other scholars, which, being
based on some ancient authority, sometimes throw light on
the readings ol MSS. which have been lost.

The first printed edition (the ‘editio princeps ’) was pub·
lished at Venice, ¹⁴7²·

The textual notes at the end ol this edition do not iorm
an apparatus crr‘tr‘cur3 they are limited to cases in which
there is divergence of opinion among recent editors as to
the true reading. But all readings lor which the present
editor is responsible are accompanied by a note. Readings
ol the Palatine MSS. are here given in blach type and
accompanied by the symbol P, minor discrepaneies between
B, C, and D being as a rule disregarded. The symbol P
thus points to the readings oi the archetype oi Boo-a MS.
