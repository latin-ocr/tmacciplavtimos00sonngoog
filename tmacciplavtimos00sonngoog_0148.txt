Most 01 the names 01 characters in this play are significant names
(‘redende Namen’, lit. speaking names, Lessing), ie. names which
{liiieiiiiifiiiffilt llil 1111111 titlte'itiltith
them are merely conve’ntional symbols 101 certain rdles, e. g. Simo 101
1180111 man, especially one who is cheated 01 his money (ci. Hor. A.P.
a .

3Τ)11110 is a correctly formed Greek name (Opaviuv), though one
which is not actually found iu Greek; see Bergk,0pusc. 1108. Its
meaning may be ‘servus remigis ministerio functus’ (so Bergk), 01 11
may be formed (as Schmidt suggests, Hermes, vol. 37, p. 369) from
θρᾶνος 11 the sense 01 ‘tanner's bench ⁹, a sense which appears in the
verb θρανεύως 01. Aristoph. Eq. 369 ἡ βύρσα σου θρανευσεται, ‘your
hide shall be tanned‘, ie. you shall be flogged. ‘'lanner'‚ with a
latent suggestion 01 1 passive meaning, would be a suitable name ior
a slave, especially one 01 the character 01 Tranio. Ritschl derived the
name from τρανής 01 τρανός, ‘ keen-witted'3 on which Fay iu American
Journal es Philolegy, XXIV. 3. p. ²50 ff. bases further suggestions.
Ussing drew attention to line 1115 Ne saxis .· nam elixus esse quam
011111 soleo suaue'er aud hinted that Tranio may be derived from the
nume 01 some fish: Lorem quoted also 1070 Non ege illi extemplo
hamum ostendam, sensim neittam lineam, and suggests θρανίς, opertas,
‘swordhsh’ as the Greek original. For the by·iorm Tranius see 560.

Grumio is probably a masculine form 01 the name Γρυμαία 01
Γρυμέα, which is found in the catalogue 01 hetairae in Athenaeus, XIII.
5831, and which pro rly denotes ‘bag ‘, ‘pocket ', ‘ purse'. See
Schmidt (loc. cit.) an Ritschl, Opusc. III. 307. 01 Shakespeare¹s

see tr. ,xvi

Philolaches (φίλος, λάχος ‘lot’), is asuitable name 101 011 who
stakes his 10111111 01 1 haurd, or treats liic us a game 01 chance:
‘Haphaeard‘. Compare the compounds φιλόκυβος, φιλοπότης, φιλο-
θύτης, φιλόξενος, φιληλιαστής in Aristoph. Vesp. 75, 79, 80, 88. The
name hildelerius appears in an inscription 01 Tanagra (Schmidt, 100.
ti..restituentesethites {titt 1111111
ment'in Poeu. 366), ‘liissy ',' a common name in luter Greek literature;
01. Luciau, Mer. Dial. XI. a. Note that diminutive names 01 females
in -a'um ure leminiue; see 01 l. 253·

snepha. the name 01 the aged attendant on Philematium, is probably
intended 10 suggest ‘Cup '-a sense which the diminutive 10111 σκάφιον
has in Athenaeus (IV. 142 d, XI. 475 c) and in Plaut Bacch. 70, Stich.
693, 11 both 01 which passages scaphium is associated with cantharus.
There is, therefore, 11 allusion 10 the drinking propensities 01 this old
woman; 01. liue 238 nam neque edes neque bibes, &c The name
Canthara in Epid. 567 has a similar origin. Plautus is fond 01 repre-

‘ sentiug old women as drunkards‚ e. g. Leaena in the Curculio. (Schmidt,

loc. cit.) As to the rdle 01 Scapha see critical note 01 113.
