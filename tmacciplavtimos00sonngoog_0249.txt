289. After this line the MSS. have
Postea nequisquam exornata est bene sl morata est male
Pulchrum ornatum turpes mores polus oaeno oontluuut
which are quigg unsuitable in this context ; the second line is transcribed
lrom Poen. .

30²· iam Camerarius, lor tam P, which might possibly bear the sense
‘lor ever so long'3 cf. Cure. 171 and, sor the ‘ deiotic’ use ol tam,
Trin. 609 (tarn ηιοᾱο, a provincialisme‘ just now’, ‘only recently').
ll this delence ol tamdiu is sound, perhaps we ought to read it also
in Capt. 882 in the sense ‘ever so long ago' (to be connected with
subrupui! in the previous line).
305. Alter this verse the MSS. have (306)-
Haeo qul gaudent gaudeant perpetuo suo semper bono
and then, alter 308-—

This latter line most editors have put alter 306, but Langen has proved “,
it to be unplautiue, though the sentiment is notunsuitable (el. Pers. 776 s·)² ¹
