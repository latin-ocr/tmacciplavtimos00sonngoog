INTRODUCTION

Tun Mostellaria¹, like other plays ol Plautina, is founded
on a Greek original: this was called Φάσμ, ‘The Ghost,’ ‘l
as we learn lrom the didaskalia, or notice appended to the ¹
play by the grammarians (see p. rix). There were several
plays of this name belonging to the νέα κωμῳδία; probably
the one in question was written by Philemon ², from whom
Plautus also borrowed the plot ol his Trinummus and Mer·
cator. Whether the Phasma Catulla a mime ol the early
empire mentioned by Juvenal VIII. 186, had any connexion
with any os these earlier ghost·plays is not known.

The scene is laid in a public street in Athens (cl. 30, 66,
1671) in which stand the houses os Theoropides (or Theo· ’
propides³) and Simo. The action lasts from early morning⁴
till late in the altemoon: cs. notes on 1.1,1. 2,1. 3, l. 4, and
lines 579 redito huc circiter mercidem, 651 iam adpetit rneri-
dies, 966 uide sr's ne sorte ad merendam quopiam deuortcrr's.

Between the two houses, which occupy the back os the stage,
is the opening os a narrow side-street (engebertum, cf. 1646),
employed in several passages os the play as a place from
which the conversation on the stage may he overheard. The
