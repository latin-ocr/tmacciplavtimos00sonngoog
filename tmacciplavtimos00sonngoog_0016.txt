seven months, owing to the discovery that it was haunted.
In an admirable scene Tranio pretends that Theoropides has
himself incurred the resentment of the Ghost by knoelring at
the door os his house, and so converts the ghost·story into
a matter oi present and patent fact; Theoropides is only too
glad to be able to escape with his head wrapped up in his
cloak (captia obuoluto 424).

But so far only the first difficulty has been overcome.
Theoropides returns when he has recovered from his fright,

having made inquiries oi the person from whom he bought
the house: the latter has indignantly denied the whole story.

he is equal to the occasion. He advises Theoropides to go
to law with the refractory vendor os the house. The debt

he does not deny, but explains it as a necessary means oi ·

be abandoned. He even induces Theoropides to promise

payment next day, and Misargyrides departs pacified.

delight oi the old man oi business knows no bounds; his
son is a chip ol the old bloclr. Yet another awkward demand
oi Theoropides-that he should be shown over the house-
is met by the reminder that there are ladies therein, whose
permission must first be asked. (That Philolaches is not in
present possession of the house, but in the country, is not
explicitly stated in the text as we have it, but seems rather to

be assumed or inferred5 cl. note ou 929.) Theoropides
