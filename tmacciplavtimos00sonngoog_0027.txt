xxii INTRODUCTION

1065. Camerarius, the great German student of Plautus o
the sixteenth century, restored all these passages to thet
proper places 3 but in one point he went too far, Hi
transferred the whole scene beginning Quid tibi urium
mercimoni (904) from its present position and inserted i
between the scene ending 857 and the scene beginning 858
The order of Camerarius was followed by the Vulgate, â€šst
that this scene bears the traditional description 111. 3,

Ritschl restored it to its present position, which is also
its position in the MSS.
